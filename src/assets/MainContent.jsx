        I’m a frontend developer who loves building clean, modern, and intuitive
        user interfaces. I’m passionate about simplifying workflows, automating
        repetitive tasks, and creating experiences that feel smooth and
        effortless. I stay focused on improving my skills every day—whether
        that’s learning new tools, sharpening best practices, or exploring ways
        to make applications faster, smarter, and more user-friendly.
